| Custom assets
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom assets are stored in the 'custom-assets' directory found inside the 'extra' folder.
Custom assets can be any file you would like to use in your theme.
For example: JS, CSS or image files.

You can load these custom assets with a built-in function, 'themeAsset()'.
Add the file you want to add to yourÂ 'custom-assets' folder, and include the name with the file extension in the function.

Down below, you can find a few examples using this function:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{themeAsset('your.css')}}">
<script src="{{themeAsset('your.js')}}"></script>
<style>body{background-image: url({{themeAsset('your.png')}});}</style>
